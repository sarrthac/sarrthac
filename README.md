### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I'm Sarthak, somebody who's just trying to get through this crazy world while some having fun and learning a thing or two along the way. I'm a software engineer by profession, but my interests and goals are much larger than just code. **I want to make a positive impact in the world**, and code is just one avenue that I use to achieve that.
